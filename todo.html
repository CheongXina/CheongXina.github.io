    <strong><u>Decomposing Corpses</u></strong>.
    <ul>
        When someone dies you have the option to bury them, in which a small grave mound will appear.
        <br>Alternatively if you do nothing the corpse will stay in the position it was and bloat, shrivel up,
        and after a long enough time turn almost fully into a skeleton. The length from start to final decomposition is about 30 days.
        Decomposing unburied corpses sour the mood of the rest of the NPCs and increase chances of disease.

    </ul>
    <br>
    <b><u>Stealing Owned Goods</u></b>.
    <ul>
        Some goods have an owner associated with them, either a faction or specific NPC. If stealing from a specific NPC
        the game will look if the NPC has a faction associated with him. When you pick up an item your player character momentarily has a tag 
        labeled 'stealing' for a few seconds, if an NPC if the faction you are stealing from happens to be looking at you, you will be attacked by
        all NPCs of that faction and have a soured relationship with said faction, and NPC owner if they exist.
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong><u>Wall Crawling Monsters</u></strong>.
    <ul>
        Monster characters can crawl on walls. This could be accomplished by having a floating pawn movement along with character movement;
        Character movement component gets disabled when Floating Pawn movement component is enabled. Then
        the character swivels head around, casting a short ray trace from their eyes, if they hit a wall object, they
        go close as they can to the wall object, facing the wall object, and then initiate a crawling animation and move up a little bit
        continously casting a short ray from their abdomen to readjust to the curvature of the wall if there is one,
        while moving in randomized directions at the same time.
