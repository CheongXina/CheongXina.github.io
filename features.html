    Unknown Era uses Windows <b>sapi.h</b> in order to provide text to speech voices for characters.
    How this is works is that when a character speaks the speech class checks the game state for a speech object pointer,
    if NULL, speech object is created and stored in the game state as a pointer. If not NULL, the stored speech object pointer is used
    to be operated with speech commands.
    When a level is left, the speech object in the game state is destroyed. The speech object is not persistent.

    and runs the World Automation Manager to calculate changes to the data of the game world, events, places and characters
